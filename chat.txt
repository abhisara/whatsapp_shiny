10/22/2015, 4:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: what do you want me to say.. I can't make further plans with you then right..
10/22/2015, 4:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: ego pe aagayi hai baat ab toh
10/22/2015, 4:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: :D

10/22/2015, 4:41 PM - Tanu: No idea
10/22/2015, 4:41 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Well..
10/22/2015, 4:42 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: later then..
10/22/2015, 4:43 PM - Tanu: Matlab?
10/22/2015, 4:43 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Matlab I can't decide now but I am definitely not happy..
10/22/2015, 4:44 PM - Tanu: Ok fair enough
10/22/2015, 4:47 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: are you from delhi ?  I mean I know you stayed in dubai and all..
10/22/2015, 4:58 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Don't answer that. irrelevant.. I think we should call it quits. I don't suppose we'd be a good match even if we try to continue this..
10/22/2015, 6:27 PM - Tanu: I'm from mumbai. And if that's what you think then that's fine
10/22/2015, 6:28 PM - Tanu: In all honesty I'm looking for something short and more like a friends with benefits situation. If you're interested let me know
10/22/2015, 6:35 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Quite a disarming way to come back from the dead..
10/22/2015, 6:36 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: well.. I told you the last time too, cancelling without apologizing profusely annoys me no ends..
10/22/2015, 6:36 PM - Tanu: I was in a meeting
10/22/2015, 6:36 PM - Tanu: As you can probably tell I don't have time for a relationship
10/22/2015, 6:36 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: tumhara ego hai ya jo bhi, I am not fine with it at all...
10/22/2015, 6:36 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is not a relationship .. It is courtesy..
10/22/2015, 6:36 PM - Tanu: Ego ki baat nahi hai
10/22/2015, 6:37 PM - Tanu: If I genuinely have things to do then I have to cancel
10/22/2015, 6:37 PM - Tanu: I'm not sitting around doing nothing and going like let him wait
10/22/2015, 6:37 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: you can cancel if things come up.. well the point is getting lost in this conversation ..
10/22/2015, 6:38 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: let the bad blood clear up a bit and we will chat again..
10/22/2015, 6:38 PM - Tanu: I'm at an event now and I have training tomorrow. What do you want me to do
10/22/2015, 6:38 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Because honestly, this gets me way too furious..
10/22/2015, 6:39 PM - Tanu: I get that it annoys you
10/22/2015, 6:39 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Alright.. I'll take that as an apology
10/22/2015, 6:39 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I am from Pune..
10/22/2015, 6:40 PM - Tanu: To be honest, I'm sorry I had to cancel bt if I was on the situation again I would do the same thing
10/22/2015, 6:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: not really from there.. anyway that's what I say
10/22/2015, 6:40 PM - Tanu: Your name sounds maharashtrian
10/22/2015, 6:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Thank you for the word sorry there.. exactly my point
10/22/2015, 6:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I am more kannada..
10/22/2015, 6:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It's complicated
10/22/2015, 6:40 PM - Tanu: Ok

10/22/2015, 6:42 PM - Tanu: Bye
10/22/2015, 6:55 PM - Tanu: I'm at an event
10/22/2015, 6:55 PM - Tanu: What's up
10/22/2015, 6:55 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Oh.. Alright. Will talk to you later
10/22/2015, 6:56 PM - Tanu: No. We can message now
10/22/2015, 6:56 PM - Tanu: But I'm at a talk. So can't answer my phone
10/22/2015, 6:57 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm not much of a texter I'm afraid.. And the call was something else
10/22/2015, 6:57 PM - Tanu: Matlab?
10/22/2015, 6:58 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Call later na..

10/22/2015, 7:00 PM - Tanu: Or that I'm not scamming you?
10/22/2015, 7:01 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Pretty restless scorpion you are..
10/22/2015, 7:01 PM - Tanu: Yup

10/22/2015, 7:04 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Don't be so barefaced about it..
10/22/2015, 7:05 PM - Tanu: Why not. There is no point in mincing my words. Creates unrealistic expectations
10/22/2015, 7:06 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Trust me you will not be the first one I have such a relationship with
10/22/2015, 7:06 PM - Tanu: And you won't be either
10/22/2015, 7:06 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Makes me feel very good. Haha

10/23/2015, 12:32 AM - Tanu: Soo
10/23/2015, 12:32 AM - Tanu: Just send it
10/23/2015, 12:32 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I feel like writing some poetry.. I'll send what I remember of it
10/23/2015, 12:33 AM - Tanu: Lol
10/23/2015, 12:33 AM - Tanu: Ok
10/23/2015, 12:33 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Although I don't mind this, I do consider myself a sort of hopeless romantic. 
There is nothing you need to fear about me having different expectations but I'd still like you to be a little considerate if not a lot. I'd make love to you tender and rough but I'd like it if things don't get messy. We split mutually and not with bad blood.
10/23/2015, 12:34 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: read with that song in the background.. :)
10/23/2015, 12:34 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: ok ok..
10/23/2015, 12:34 AM - Tanu: Ok
10/23/2015, 12:34 AM - Tanu: Is that for me?
10/23/2015, 12:34 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: yes
10/23/2015, 12:35 AM - Tanu: We won't end in bad blood
10/23/2015, 12:35 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: :)
10/23/2015, 12:35 AM - Tanu: ??
10/23/2015, 12:36 AM - Tanu: It's really well written btw
10/23/2015, 12:36 AM - Tanu: Do you write often
10/23/2015, 12:36 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is pretty nice to be so open about it.. before even meeting the person.
10/23/2015, 12:36 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yeah.. I like to.
10/23/2015, 12:37 AM - Tanu: It is nice
10/23/2015, 12:37 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: If I fall in love I switch to poetry which I think is better than that para.. :D
10/23/2015, 12:37 AM - Tanu: Lol
10/23/2015, 12:37 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: what do you do ?
10/23/2015, 12:37 AM - Tanu: You are a romantic
10/23/2015, 12:38 AM - Tanu: I've become cynical over the last couple of years
10/23/2015, 12:38 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: when I am high.. yes... sober me is practical haha
10/23/2015, 12:38 AM - Tanu: Still hopeful though
10/23/2015, 12:38 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Good

10/25/2015, 10:37 PM - Tanu: But I still think Ill love someone like you and rolling in the deep better
10/25/2015, 11:54 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I love someone like you too. ???
10/26/2015, 12:22 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: We left
10/26/2015, 12:22 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Oh sorry.. Wait I'll call you
10/26/2015, 12:46 AM - Tanu: Left?
10/26/2015, 10:03 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Tum badi battameez ho
10/26/2015, 10:04 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: When I call you , call back nahi karti tum.   Where are you ? In India..
10/26/2015, 10:05 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok
10/26/2015, 10:05 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Good luck
10/26/2015, 10:06 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: All back to good now.. :)
10/26/2015, 10:38 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Half an hour .. I waited so long so at least one of your exams gets over. But yes the notice about being busy despite being so busy is appreciated. ( not sarcasm , sincerely )
10/26/2015, 10:39 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I need to meet you soon yaar.. This romanticizing you will be over then. If uske baad bhi chalta hai then we are trouble Tanya..
10/26/2015, 10:40 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Then I'll tell you gone girl ka dialogue. Not so soon, someday..
10/26/2015, 10:41 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Tum padhai pe focus karo for another 3 hours . :)
10/26/2015, 10:42 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I was supposed to work from home.. Nahi ho payega pata chala morning mein so took a PTO..
10/26/2015, 10:43 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Watch "Bastille - Flaws" on YouTube - https://youtu.be/1E36WU9Wzf4
10/26/2015, 10:43 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: This played in the cheesecake factory yesterday..  So it is the song for today. ??
10/26/2015, 10:44 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Also, I'm looking forward to a time when I don't see so many crying emoticons on profile..
10/26/2015, 10:44 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Jaldi karo exam khatam
10/26/2015, 10:44 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: ??
10/26/2015, 10:55 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Another interesting thought. Good you have exams else I'd have you told you everything I think about you.
10/26/2015, 10:55 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Which I guess I'm going to write anyway..
10/26/2015, 10:55 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yes.. The thought is -
10/26/2015, 10:59 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I reach out to you each time from a position of vulnerability. With the knowledge that any turn might be our last turn. 
Which makes me have a nothing to lose frame of mind, makes me fearless enough to be writing such messages to you. Because God knows showing all your cards is such a bad move while courting/pursuing a woman.
10/26/2015, 11:00 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: But the heartbreak is around or might be and my heart is ready for it 24/7 .
10/26/2015, 11:01 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: This interesting combination is what makes me fearless and vulnerable at the same time.
10/26/2015, 11:02 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: The like the combination very much indeed. :)
10/26/2015, 11:05 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Before I go any further I'd like to give you some credit. I assure you that this partly is your effect. You have managed to say some of right things at the right time.
10/26/2015, 11:06 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Bas aaj ke subah ke chai ke saath Mann ki baat mein itna hi..
10/26/2015, 11:39 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Accha ek aur cheez batana tha waise.
10/26/2015, 11:41 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I think I'll wait till you finish reading this. Very likely I won't remember later on. Par koi gal nahi.. I will remember it if it is important enough
10/26/2015, 12:59 PM - Tanu: Aur kya batana tha
10/26/2015, 12:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: There you are
10/26/2015, 12:59 PM - Tanu: Haha yeah
10/26/2015, 12:59 PM - Tanu: Submitted one exam. Finishing he other one now
10/26/2015, 1:00 PM - Tanu: Then I have one more class
10/26/2015, 1:00 PM - Tanu: Bas then I'll have some time
10/26/2015, 1:00 PM - Tanu: I read what you wrote. And it's lovely. Par is Sab ke baad main fursat se padhoongi phir se
10/26/2015, 1:06 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yeah whenever you are free..
10/26/2015, 1:06 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Brb
10/26/2015, 1:54 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Koi nahi.. Aap fursat se padhoge toh main aur likh deta hu yaha
10/26/2015, 1:55 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: This is the best phase Tanya where we both imagine perfect versions of each other.
10/26/2015, 1:56 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Taking a detour, a Nick name for you would help too.
10/26/2015, 1:56 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Tanu weds manu wala tanu ?
10/26/2015, 1:57 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I prefer single syllable wale nick names waise .. Like Tan. Or maybe  ton. Which sounds a lot like Hindi ka tan. Which is a problem.
10/26/2015, 1:57 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Tum bhi ideas de sakti ho mujhe.
10/26/2015, 1:57 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: No no.. Don't come online..
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Tanu: Lol a lot of people call me Tanu
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Tanu: U can call me that
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Nicee
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Tanu: Can I call you Abhi
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Koi single syllable alternative hai ?
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Tanu: Nahi
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Haha.. A lot of people people call me that too
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Abhi is perfect
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Tanu: Toh kya bulaoon
10/26/2015, 1:58 PM - Tanu: U choose
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: You can call me Sarapure as well..
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Tanu: No thanks
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Tanu: Abhi is better
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: James Bond type naam lagta hai
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: ????
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Tanu: Hahaha
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Abhi
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: You can make all those jokes as well. Abhi tum kaha ho ?
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Tanu: Hahaha
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: ????
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Padho tanu
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Tanu: And waise I'm nowhere near perfect
10/26/2015, 1:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Don't let me keep you here
10/26/2015, 2:00 PM - Tanu: You will figure out soon enough
10/26/2015, 2:00 PM - Tanu: Not physically and definitely not emotionally
10/26/2015, 2:00 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yess. Exactly. Good will hunting dekhi hai tumne ?
10/26/2015, 2:00 PM - Tanu: Bahut pehle
10/26/2015, 2:00 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Usme dialogue hai
10/26/2015, 2:00 PM - Tanu: I think I fell asleep
10/26/2015, 2:00 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Oh hoo...
10/26/2015, 2:01 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Robin Williams says.. Long para ahead.. Come back after 2 mins
10/26/2015, 2:01 PM - Tanu: Lol
10/26/2015, 2:03 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: You don't wanna get to know her more because you think she will not be perfect. Let me save you the surprise. She is not perfect. And you are not perfect either. The point is whether you two are perfect for each other.
10/26/2015, 2:11 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Because even though I haven't met you I think this will be the first of many things I might ask of you in life. Right now it would be exclusivity. I'd rather be heartbroken from a heart that was in it than just no heart at all - heartlessly you can't have me anymore. Things have changed, thanks to all the effort by me and the turbulent yet strong emotional you I have felt over chat. We both know the odds of a match in real are low. But I'd rather you let me see your heart than nothing at all. So yes... exclusivity Tanu. Sorry, I'm changing the parameters a bit.
10/26/2015, 2:13 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Good will dialogue ends with 'perfect for each other ' pe..
10/26/2015, 2:13 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Uske baad sab kuch main bol raha hu
10/26/2015, 2:13 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: To you
10/26/2015, 2:19 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Watch "Bastille - Flaws Lyrics" on YouTube - https://youtu.be/WDoU-gE2AXA
10/26/2015, 2:19 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: This song also elaborates on my point.
10/26/2015, 2:26 PM - Tanu: I don't mind exclusivity. But if I meet someone I want to date and vice versa we can get out. No bad blood. Is that a deal?
10/26/2015, 2:38 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Mood change ke saath naya gana
10/26/2015, 2:38 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Watch "Portishead - The Rip" on YouTube - https://youtu.be/kBOaLjtR4mw
10/26/2015, 2:38 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: But we will talk about this after we meet. Shayad nahi ho payega mujhse Tanu
10/26/2015, 2:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I mean your point is fine..
10/26/2015, 2:40 PM - Tanu: Kyun
10/26/2015, 2:41 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't want you having a backup plan.
10/26/2015, 2:41 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Stop asking questions...
10/26/2015, 2:42 PM - Tanu: Lol
10/26/2015, 2:42 PM - Tanu: Ok fine.
10/26/2015, 2:42 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Milne ke baad baat karenge
10/26/2015, 2:42 PM - Tanu: We're meeting tomorrow at 9pm right
10/26/2015, 2:42 PM - Tanu: Kahan Milna hai
10/26/2015, 2:42 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: What if I wanna date you?
10/26/2015, 2:43 PM - Tanu: And what if I only have as much time as I've had in the last few days
10/26/2015, 2:43 PM - Tanu: Will you be happy with that
10/26/2015, 2:43 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Forever?
10/26/2015, 2:43 PM - Tanu: Have u ever thought what if u meet me and U don't want to date me
10/26/2015, 2:43 PM - Tanu: For the next year, yeah
10/26/2015, 2:44 PM - Tanu: Maybe not as intense
10/26/2015, 2:44 PM - Tanu: But I definitely won't be able to meet/chat for hours everyday
10/26/2015, 2:44 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I haven't given it much of a thought. You're right.
10/26/2015, 2:45 PM - Tanu: You are thinking about the best possible scenario. Jahan U really like me and I like you
10/26/2015, 2:45 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Then stop doing whatever you are doing through chat
10/26/2015, 2:45 PM - Tanu: Par what if you don't
10/26/2015, 2:45 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Haha.. Nicee
10/26/2015, 2:45 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yes
10/26/2015, 2:45 PM - Tanu: What am i doing
10/26/2015, 2:45 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: What if you don't
10/26/2015, 2:46 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Love is a choice tanu..
10/26/2015, 2:46 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Okay .. That is too far ahead
10/26/2015, 2:46 PM - Tanu: You're not in love
10/26/2015, 2:46 PM - Tanu: Exactly
10/26/2015, 2:46 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yea yea... I mean liking too
10/26/2015, 2:46 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'll stop talking
10/26/2015, 2:46 PM - Tanu: Take it one step at a time.
10/26/2015, 2:47 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: ????
10/26/2015, 2:47 PM - Tanu: Pehle do the fun stuff. Then get to the senti stuff
10/26/2015, 2:47 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't know about that
10/26/2015, 2:47 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I have crossed that point
10/26/2015, 2:47 PM - Tanu: Crossed what point
10/26/2015, 2:47 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is not fun anymore..
10/26/2015, 2:48 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I need to see you soon
10/26/2015, 2:49 PM - Tanu: I don't mind dating. But I need to take it very slowly when it comes to the emotional stuff. The last time I got really involved and it still hurts at times. And I can't go there again
10/26/2015, 2:49 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Good.. I understand
10/26/2015, 2:49 PM - Tanu: I swear. Baby steps.
10/26/2015, 2:49 PM - Tanu: But I want to have fun
10/26/2015, 2:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: One second
10/26/2015, 2:53 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: You're right. Less expectations from this the better
10/26/2015, 2:54 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm probably high which is why I'm talking like this
10/26/2015, 2:54 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I need to talk to you
10/26/2015, 2:55 PM - Tanu: Lol

10/26/2015, 2:56 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Just not very good cautious moves
10/26/2015, 2:56 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve like you do too
10/26/2015, 2:56 PM - Tanu: Abhi. You need to get un-high. Then we will talk about this

You wait for me only. 
At a bar looking all spiffy.
I hesitant at first make my move slowly
Consuming each other in time that went by in a jiffy. 
Laughing, crying, cuddling and telling stories
Spend the next day in wonder of a sleepless surreal night.

11/14/2015, 9:29 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: tread carefully .. I don't like playing these games doesn't mean I can't

11/15/2015, 5:37 PM - Tanu: Whatever you want
11/15/2015, 5:38 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I haven't gotten free yet baccha
11/15/2015, 5:38 PM - Tanu: Ok
11/15/2015, 9:37 PM - Tanu: Hi baby,
I don't write a lot like you and I definitely cannot do poetry. But I wanted to write down how I feel about you. So I'm warning you, this isn't going to be beautiful eloquent poetry, but just how I feel.

When I "liked" you on OkCupid, I never imagined that we would be here, today. When we set up our first date and what eventually ended up being our first date, I still didn't think I would like you as much as I do today. 
But today, for the first time since we met, I've let myself think about US.
It's weird to think that a little over 2 weeks ago, I didn't even know you because today, you are the only person I have shared so much with. You are the only person who knows how I really think and feel and because of that you are the only one who sees past the bullshit. You know my many many fears, all my insecurities and you still haven't run away. You're the only man I've met in the last 10 years who's liked me just the way I am and haven't taunted me about everything thats wrong with me, or change me. You're the only one who hasn't judged me for what I can only describe as "my sexual appetite". You're the only one who has cuddled with me and hasn't pushed me away the moment you get what you want. You're the only one who's cared at all. And for all of this and much much more, I'll always be grateful.

Now, for the shitty part of this. I've thought about this over and over again and questioned this again and again. But I know for sure that we don't have a future. 
We had decided not to talk for 25 more days, but the more I think about it, that's only going to hurt us (me) more. SO I think that we shouldn't talk at all. Give me a little while to get over you. And maybe some day we can be friends. 

Love always,
Tanvi
11/15/2015, 9:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I knew it had an ending.
11/15/2015, 9:40 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I mean this long piece had the ending somewhere
11/15/2015, 9:40 PM - Tanu: I didn't start writing it with that intention
11/15/2015, 9:41 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Why sugar it so much ?
11/15/2015, 9:41 PM - Tanu: But the more I thought about it. It became clear
11/15/2015, 9:41 PM - Tanu: Because it's the truth
11/15/2015, 9:41 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Give me the hard truth Tanu..
11/15/2015, 9:41 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't want this
11/15/2015, 9:42 PM - Tanu: The truth is that I love you. But I can't see us lasting beyond a year
11/15/2015, 9:42 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: ok
11/15/2015, 9:43 PM - Tanu: Are you ok?
11/15/2015, 9:43 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: yeah.. I am fine.
11/15/2015, 9:44 PM - Tanu: Say whatever you want to
11/15/2015, 9:44 PM - Tanu: You keep typing then stopping
11/15/2015, 9:44 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: There is still something missing in that entire piece. I am not going to rack my brain to find out the missing piece because you are not easy to read..
11/15/2015, 9:45 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: But I won't ask you to give it to me cold either. I'll let this be this way and we can probably be friends someday ..
11/15/2015, 9:46 PM - Tanu: Yeah. I really hope so. Because I think we understand each other pretty well
11/15/2015, 9:46 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: :) I think the same
11/15/2015, 9:46 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm glad you wrote this..
11/15/2015, 9:47 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: not in a bad way but I think it is important to know what the other person is thinking..
11/15/2015, 9:47 PM - Tanu: If it's possible, I want to see you. One last time. For like half an hour. I understand if you're busy though
11/15/2015, 9:47 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Tonight ?
11/15/2015, 9:47 PM - Tanu: I don't want to carry this over to the rest of the week. Tomorrow needs to be a fresh slate
11/15/2015, 9:48 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm sorry Tanu.. I am not to blame if your word means a little less to me now..
11/15/2015, 9:48 PM - Tanu: I know
11/15/2015, 9:49 PM - Tanu: I'm not the most disciplined person
11/15/2015, 9:49 PM - Tanu: But because I need to protect myself I'll have to be
11/15/2015, 9:49 PM - Tanu: So. It remains to be seen
11/15/2015, 9:49 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: So I am going to cut across your artificial deadline for tonight and we will meet this week when we both have time..
11/15/2015, 9:50 PM - Tanu: I can't promise that
11/15/2015, 9:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is upto you if you want to meet after tonight.. I am fine either way
11/15/2015, 9:50 PM - Tanu: Ok
11/15/2015, 11:26 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Hi Tanu, 

I am grateful for a lot too. 
I will be talking about it soon lest you think 
I don't love you as much. It won't be today 
though as I am humbled by your leaving. It is 
a reminder to me the fragile state of relationships.
The ease with which a void can be created. 
Having said that, taking nothing away from you, you have 
gone about this in a beautiful way and like we talked about 
it in the beginning about how we won't make it messy. 
We have done all that and a lot more. I am always going 
to look at you fondly. 
Although short, I did connect with you very easily 
which is a hard thing to for me come by.  
And I'm glad I met you.

Love, 
Abhi
11/16/2015, 4:23 AM - Tanu: I'm glad I met you too
11/16/2015, 4:25 AM - Tanu: You're awake?
11/16/2015, 4:26 AM - Tanu: That was mean btw. I don't love you as much..
11/16/2015, 4:27 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Mean in whose part?
11/16/2015, 4:27 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: On*
11/16/2015, 4:27 AM - Tanu: Like it was intended to hurt me
11/16/2015, 4:27 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm not really awake you can see??
11/16/2015, 4:28 AM - Tanu: Hmm
11/16/2015, 4:28 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: No baba...

12/4/15, 2:03 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: but one more thing which I am saying now because I am uninhibited enough that I can say all this to you .. at the same time in control of what I speak .. so no woohh wali baatein like you asked me to. 
So the thing is I'd always be very proud of how much you achieve in life. I'd love to see you soar. I don't want you to take this away from me. so don't be gussa with me. mat rootho mujhse.. mat dhundho bahane to push me away from your life. I can't be really close to you because if both of us are emotionally draining for each other. But I don't want to be nobody either for you. Because there are very few people I connect with like I do with you. Keep me at a safe distance (I'll keep that in mind too ) and we will get along just fine.
12/4/15, 2:05 PM - Tanu: Say this to me sober and you have a deal

12/21/15, 4:19 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: don't prioritise that well...
12/21/15, 4:19 PM - Tanu: I always think about it this way. In a moment you should always do exactly what you want to be doing. Not what you think you should do because of time etc
12/21/15, 4:24 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: that won't be applicable in so many situations..
12/21/15, 4:24 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I want to go back home and sleep..

12/21/15, 4:25 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: interestin
12/21/15, 4:25 PM - Tanu: Don't think about how many times you have left to do something
12/21/15, 4:25 PM - Tanu: Trust me. I do. It is not fun. You get very anxious
12/21/15, 4:26 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I read so many random articles.. this article made me think that those articles are cutting into my time a lot more and they are not even that useful..

12/21/15, 4:28 PM - Tanu: Sort t out and keep it to the side
12/21/15, 4:28 PM - Tanu: If after a few days you feel the same way throw it out
12/21/15, 4:29 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: oh no.. I won't .. the only thing I regret throwing is something that I have written..
12/21/15, 4:29 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: everything else has been fine till now
12/21/15, 4:29 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'll give this a few days though..
12/21/15, 4:29 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: but the seed has been sown..
12/21/15, 4:29 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: and it is going to get me anxious..

12/24/15, 9:35 AM - Tanu: Its ok baby. I'll be back soon
12/24/15, 9:35 AM - Tanu: And when you're in NY you won't even think of it
12/24/15, 9:35 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Probably
12/24/15, 9:36 AM - Tanu: Have fun there
12/24/15, 9:36 AM - Tanu: Good normal fun

12/24/15, 12:11 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: We will talk later sometime..
12/24/15, 12:11 PM - Tanu: No. Now
12/24/15, 12:11 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: call karo
12/24/15, 8:58 PM - Tanu: Abhi, 
There are some things I need to say. You ended things so quickly, I didn't even get a chance to process it. 
When you told me what you were thinking about, I knew where you would take this. You go through these phases, this is very similar to what you did last time- Broke things off just as I was giving my midterms. I don't understand why you pick these times to do such things, I don't even have the time or energy to argue with you. And now you've left me in a situation where I'm forced to smile through it all to my friends. 
All I wanted was to come back and see you and spend a few days with you. But now you're going to ruin what could have been the best few days of us, based on what seems to be a half baked idea. 
I love you Abhi. And right now you're my lifeline. You are the one things that keeps me happy and sane. I hope you change your mind but I can't force you. And I hope at some point you realize that spending time with people you enjoy is a big part of life and time isn't just measured by the number of times you go to the beach or go skydiving. It's about the people you do those things with. 
Love
Tanvi
12/24/15, 10:10 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Tanu, Will write back tomorrow morning. Can't think right now. Take Care..
12/24/15, 10:11 PM - Tanu: Whatever you want. That's what happens anyway
12/24/15, 11:32 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I feel bad about this too.. As much as I would have enjoyed the last few days of the year with you, I don't feel any of it now. And I'm going to bring to end anything which has no chance of lasting. Rather emotionally invest myself in other things. 

I don't see the timing being better but understand what you are saying. I couldn't have hurt you with you in front of me, so phone it was for me.
12/24/15, 11:57 PM - Tanu: I want it to last though. You don't even want to try
12/24/15, 11:59 PM - Tanu: And you can't do it in front of me because you don't want to
12/24/15, 11:59 PM - Tanu: And I think if we try, there is no reason it can't last
12/25/15, 12:36 PM - Tanu: You don't want to say anything else??
12/25/15, 1:21 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Maybe we can talk after you come back..
12/25/15, 1:24 PM - Tanu: What are you thinking though
12/25/15, 1:25 PM - Tanu: Give me an idea at least
12/25/15, 1:28 PM - Tanu: Merry Christmas!
12/25/15, 3:27 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm still thinking what I was thinking yesterday..
12/25/15, 3:28 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: You in San Jose ?
12/25/15, 3:29 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't know what else to say about the conversation yesterday
12/25/15, 3:39 PM - Tanu: I am
12/25/15, 3:39 PM - Tanu: At Aayal's house
12/25/15, 3:40 PM - Tanu: It's on snapchat
12/25/15, 3:58 PM - Tanu: I still need to see you when I get back
12/25/15, 3:58 PM - Tanu: Are you in NY?
12/25/15, 4:20 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yeah.. In NYC.
12/25/15, 4:23 PM - Tanu: You didn't answer the other part
12/25/15, 4:23 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't know about that..
12/25/15, 4:23 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't know any other way to talk to you..
12/25/15, 4:24 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Not a good idea I think
12/25/15, 4:32 PM - Tanu: You said you'll still come and get me
12/25/15, 4:32 PM - Tanu: At the airport
12/25/15, 4:49 PM - Tanu: Bhool gaye?
12/25/15, 5:28 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: 
12/25/15, 5:29 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: You said no
12/25/15, 5:31 PM - Tanu: Now I'm saying yes
12/25/15, 5:33 PM - Tanu: Aana padega
12/25/15, 10:36 PM - Tanu: <Media omitted>
12/26/15, 12:59 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I haven't seen anything dark inside you. Don't know how this applies .. And I like you too but I doubt this will change anything..
12/26/15, 1:00 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: And stop with these messages .. #notcomingbackasfarasIknow
12/26/15, 1:01 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: That's mean of me but the fact that I can send it now is because somehow I am not affected if you are hurt a little..
12/26/15, 1:02 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: That was never the case.. Don't know what snapped but something did..
12/26/15, 1:02 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I hope you are ok
12/26/15, 1:02 AM - Tanu: I'm not
12/26/15, 1:02 AM - Tanu: Because you mean more to me than you even know
12/26/15, 1:03 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't know yaar.. Stop saying that
12/26/15, 1:03 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: What do you want now ?
12/26/15, 1:03 AM - Tanu: It's fine. You don't feel the same way. Just because something snapped inside you doesn't make my feelings change
12/26/15, 1:04 AM - Tanu: It doesn't work that way
12/26/15, 1:04 AM - Tanu: I still want you
12/26/15, 1:04 AM - Tanu: But it's your decision
12/26/15, 1:05 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: That's not happening.. I am being rude now
12/26/15, 1:05 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Your fault Tanu
12/26/15, 1:05 AM - Tanu: What's my fault
12/26/15, 1:05 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Making me be rude to you
12/26/15, 1:05 AM - Tanu: Why. You're being frank and so am I
12/26/15, 1:05 AM - Tanu: I still have a right to say whatever I want
12/26/15, 1:06 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok
12/26/15, 1:06 AM - Tanu: It's always easier for he person that walks away
12/26/15, 1:06 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: True
12/26/15, 1:06 AM - Tanu: You have a reason and something to walk towards
12/26/15, 1:06 AM - Tanu: I don't
12/26/15, 1:07 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Just go away Tanu.. I don't think I'll let myself see each other
12/26/15, 1:07 AM - Tanu: I mean we went from talking multiple times a day and seeing each other a few times a week to you basically not caring
12/26/15, 1:07 AM - Tanu: Are you drunk
12/26/15, 1:08 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yeah.. I'm befuddled
12/26/15, 1:08 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: No
12/26/15, 1:09 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: My shit to figure out and you are affected. Didn't want it to be this way
12/26/15, 1:09 AM - Tanu: Abhi it wasn't just. Right now you're one of my best friends
12/26/15, 1:09 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: We can't be friends
12/26/15, 1:09 AM - Tanu: Yeah but you have to get how alone I feel right nowYl
12/26/15, 1:10 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I can't imagine..
12/26/15, 1:10 AM - Tanu: Why did you do it. Why did you get me so involved and then leave
12/26/15, 1:10 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I have insulated myself from caring about you.. That's really weird..
12/26/15, 1:10 AM - Tanu: We shouldn't have been this close in the first place
12/26/15, 1:10 AM - Tanu: You may have. But I can't do that
12/26/15, 1:11 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: The guilt doesn't seem to be working either..
12/26/15, 1:11 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Brilliant
12/26/15, 1:11 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: You will be fine
12/26/15, 1:11 AM - Tanu: I'm not looking to guilt you into something
12/26/15, 1:11 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: You are a strong woman
12/26/15, 1:11 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I believe in you
12/26/15, 1:12 AM - Tanu: Did you find someone else
12/26/15, 1:12 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: No
12/26/15, 1:12 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'd tell you that
12/26/15, 1:12 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I won't lie to you about anything
12/26/15, 1:12 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: What changed ? No idea...
12/26/15, 1:13 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Where do we go from here ? Nowhere
12/26/15, 1:13 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: What do you do ? Get over me..
12/26/15, 1:14 AM - Tanu: Abhi
12/26/15, 1:14 AM - Tanu: Maybe your mindset has changed
12/26/15, 1:14 AM - Tanu: But I'm exactly where you left me
12/26/15, 1:14 AM - Tanu: And right now I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel
12/26/15, 1:14 AM - Tanu: And to be honest I don't want to
12/26/15, 1:14 AM - Tanu: Can I just ask one thing
12/26/15, 1:15 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yea
12/26/15, 1:15 AM - Tanu: You wanted to date with the possibility of a future. Why don't you any more
12/26/15, 1:15 AM - Tanu: I want to
12/26/15, 1:15 AM - Tanu: It took me a while to realize that I did
12/26/15, 1:15 AM - Tanu: But I do
12/26/15, 1:16 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm not meeting you after you come back
12/26/15, 1:16 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: We will fall into the same thing
12/26/15, 1:16 AM - Tanu: What am I asking you
12/26/15, 1:17 AM - Tanu: I didn't ask you abot that
12/26/15, 1:17 AM - Tanu: Answer ma
12/26/15, 1:17 AM - Tanu: I just need to know
12/26/15, 1:18 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I can't think straight
12/26/15, 1:18 AM - Tanu: You can't keep saying that
12/26/15, 1:18 AM - Tanu: I also need answers
12/26/15, 1:19 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: You make me walk a really tight line .. It is difficult .
12/26/15, 1:19 AM - Tanu: I don't make you do anything
12/26/15, 1:19 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: To get those answers
12/26/15, 1:19 AM - Tanu: I need to hear it. Good or bad
12/26/15, 1:20 AM - Tanu: Don't be diplomatic. Just say it
12/26/15, 1:20 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I still have to figure it out.. One of first things after going back is reading our first chats
12/26/15, 1:21 AM - Tanu: Figure what out
12/26/15, 1:21 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: What changed
12/26/15, 1:21 AM - Tanu: So basically you don't want to date
12/26/15, 1:21 AM - Tanu: Even proper relationship type dating
12/26/15, 1:22 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Nahi Tanu..
12/26/15, 1:22 AM - Tanu: Couldn't you have waited till I got back
12/26/15, 1:22 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: You have asked me this before
12/26/15, 1:22 AM - Tanu: I know
12/26/15, 1:22 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Can't do this in person
12/26/15, 1:23 AM - Tanu: Karna padega
12/26/15, 1:23 AM - Tanu: Why not
12/26/15, 1:23 AM - Tanu: If you can say the things you said to me today
12/26/15, 1:23 AM - Tanu: Then why not just say it in person
12/26/15, 1:23 AM - Tanu: I have no pride when it comes to you
12/26/15, 1:23 AM - Tanu: I can take it
12/26/15, 1:24 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Bas karo ab..
12/26/15, 1:24 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Nahi kuch badlega
12/26/15, 1:24 AM - Tanu: Nahi. Why do you get to decide
12/26/15, 1:24 AM - Tanu: After everything. Yu can't even do this much for me
12/26/15, 1:24 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: That's how it works..
12/26/15, 1:24 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Because I didn't question you when you decided.
12/26/15, 1:25 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: And no.. I'm not punishing you for that
12/26/15, 1:25 AM - Tanu: No. You did
12/26/15, 1:25 AM - Tanu: And that was different. It wasn't forever
12/26/15, 1:26 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: You are smart.. I don't feel like I'm banging my head against a wall when talking to you
12/26/15, 1:26 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: That's awesome
12/26/15, 1:26 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Okay.. Coming back..

12/26/15, 1:27 AM - Tanu: Fine. What else can I say. I miss you like crazy though

12/26/15, 1:32 AM - Tanu: Surely you can do that much for me
12/26/15, 1:32 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I didn't come to a decision without thinking about it
12/26/15, 1:32 AM - Tanu: Think again
12/26/15, 1:32 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is abrupt I agree
12/26/15, 1:33 AM - Tanu: And wuestion it
12/26/15, 1:33 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is a little strange.. Because I went from the poetic self to hopelessness
12/26/15, 1:34 AM - Tanu: Abhinav, hopefully at some point I meant enough to you that you will think about it again
12/26/15, 1:34 AM - Tanu: Even just as a friend I need you in my life

1/18/16, 9:55 AM - Tanu: You too
1/19/16, 11:06 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Weird turn of events.. :|
1/19/16, 11:06 PM - Tanu: I wish you would have told me sooner
1/19/16, 11:07 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: You missed some great guy because of me ?
1/19/16, 11:07 PM - Tanu: No
1/19/16, 11:07 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Then ?
1/19/16, 11:07 PM - Tanu: Just got too into this and now I need to find a way out
1/19/16, 11:08 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Well.. Wasn't the break supposed to that itself.. The future bein uncertain and we should look at our relationship objectively ..
1/19/16, 11:08 PM - Tanu: Don't worry. You don't need to say anything
1/19/16, 11:09 PM - Tanu: Yeah I agree. It was. You're not wrong
1/19/16, 11:09 PM - Tanu: I am
1/19/16, 11:09 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: You are not..
1/19/16, 11:10 PM - Tanu: Yeah I am. I should have held back
1/19/16, 11:11 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't know Tanu.. I have had this issue. I need to deal with this first
1/19/16, 11:11 PM - Tanu: I'm not trying to change your mind
1/19/16, 11:11 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I know
1/19/16, 11:12 PM - Tanu: Figure it out before you date someone else
1/19/16, 11:13 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Need to meet a few people.. Not date them
1/19/16, 11:14 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Accha theekh hai. Tum so jao
1/19/16, 11:14 PM - Tanu: Talking to my sister
1/19/16, 11:14 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: About us ?
1/19/16, 11:14 PM - Tanu: No. Her finals are going on
1/19/16, 11:14 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok..
1/19/16, 11:15 PM - Tanu: Please do me a favor and don't call me when you get back
1/19/16, 11:15 PM - Tanu: Even if you change your mind
1/19/16, 11:28 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Take care.
1/19/16, 11:49 PM - Tanu: I cannot even begin to describe how mad I am. After all this time, you decide the reason this won't work is because you're scared. As a response to what you said: I know we took a break to reconsider us. What I assumed were possible options were 1. Yes, we think this could work long term 2. No, we won't last. What I didn't know was option 3. No, because you can't commit. 
All in all, I'm glad you told me now because from this point there is no return. Nothing you say or do can bring us back and I can finally move on.
1/19/16, 11:58 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Don't be mad Tanu.. This is part of the second option. I'd like you to move on. I'm not ready and as sad as it sounds , I know I'm not going to be ready anytime soon. 
As long as we were together we were happy which I think is a good thing. I don't think you lost out on time because you never stopped looking. 
You are a strong person and it wouldn't take you long to be back to normal and we can finally stop living under this false umbrella about us succeeding..
1/20/16, 12:00 AM - Tanu: It's not. This is not about how we won't work out. But about how you don't WANT to do it.
1/20/16, 12:00 AM - Tanu: I am a strong person and I didn't "lose" time. But what i did lose is faith in anyone like you
1/20/16, 12:01 AM - Tanu: Anyway whatever
1/20/16, 12:02 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Maybe we should not talk at this point. You are pretty mad.
1/20/16, 12:03 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Stop deleting my number for everything
1/20/16, 12:03 AM - Tanu: We shouldn't talk at all
1/20/16, 12:04 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: That's fine.. Talk to someone if you need to.. I already did. I was very shaken for quite some time..
1/20/16, 12:04 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Don't be mad at me
1/20/16, 12:04 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Please
1/20/16, 12:04 AM - Tanu: Why not
1/20/16, 12:04 AM - Tanu: You deserve it
1/20/16, 12:05 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Why baccha
1/20/16, 12:05 AM - Tanu: Stop with all this crap
1/20/16, 12:05 AM - Tanu: Leave me alone
1/20/16, 12:05 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok..
1/20/16, 2:55 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Talk to me
1/20/16, 3:01 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Can we talk for sometime ?
1/20/16, 3:09 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I need you.. Please answer
1/20/16, 3:10 PM - Tanu: At work
1/20/16, 3:10 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok
1/20/16, 3:18 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: When can we talk ?
1/20/16, 3:22 PM - Tanu: Is it necessary
1/20/16, 3:22 PM - Tanu: Are you drunk
1/20/16, 3:22 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Not really.. Mujhse baat karo please
1/20/16, 3:23 PM - Tanu: Ok. In 20 mins
1/20/16, 3:23 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok...
1/20/16, 3:36 PM - Tanu: Call
1/20/16, 7:44 PM - Tanu: I'm not trying to sound cold and it's definitely not my intention to make you feed bad but I need to protect myself from getting hurt more. If you really want to meet up when you get back, we can. But think about it.
1/20/16, 8:58 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I understand. You did the right thing Tanu..
1/20/16, 9:07 PM - Tanu: Thanks
1/20/16, 11:36 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is so annoying not being able to discuss with you the marvels of medicine.. Just when I'm reading about pulmonary embolism and jugular veins and I understand none of it..
1/21/16, 2:02 AM - Tanu: Haha
1/21/16, 2:07 AM - Tanu: Good for you
1/21/16, 6:27 AM - Tanu: For the reading part
1/21/16, 6:27 AM - Tanu: Not the not understanding part
1/21/16, 7:15 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Haha..

1/21/16, 7:17 AM - Tanu: It's at a conference center
1/21/16, 7:17 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok

1/21/16, 7:17 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Nevermind
1/21/16, 7:18 AM - Tanu: Nahi. It's not necessary
1/21/16, 1:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Don't think you can hear me
1/21/16, 1:50 PM - Tanu: I can't
1/21/16, 1:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Still at the conference?

1/21/16, 1:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: 
1/21/16, 1:51 PM - Tanu: Yeah
1/21/16, 1:51 PM - Tanu: It doesn't mean anything
1/21/16, 1:51 PM - Tanu: Don't get excited
1/21/16, 1:51 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Haha.. It means you are not that mad at me anymore
1/21/16, 1:52 PM - Tanu: It means that I don't care
1/21/16, 1:52 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: If you didn't you wouldn't have bothered changing anything
1/21/16, 1:52 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Nevertheless
1/21/16, 1:52 PM - Tanu: No. It means that all this is behind me
1/21/16, 1:53 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Good
1/21/16, 1:53 PM - Tanu: I still don't want to be mean to you
1/21/16, 1:53 PM - Tanu: But you Should top messaging me regardless
1/21/16, 1:53 PM - Tanu: Stop
1/21/16, 1:53 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Hmmm
1/21/16, 1:54 PM - Tanu: I thought you were different. But you turned out just like every other guy. Different approach. Same outcome
1/21/16, 1:54 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: What was the outcome?
1/21/16, 1:54 PM - Tanu: And now you deleted my number
1/21/16, 8:52 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Good morning.. :)
1/21/16, 8:53 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I know..  Give me a couple of days
1/21/16, 8:54 PM - Tanu: It's not fair Abhi
1/21/16, 8:54 PM - Tanu: You're not making this easy for me
1/21/16, 8:54 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Okay.. I understand..
1/21/16, 8:56 PM - Tanu: I really don't understand what you want. You said you didn't want to be together. You got that. But you keep messaging and texting. PLEASE let me move on
1/21/16, 8:59 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is not easy.. I'm too used to you
1/21/16, 9:00 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Forget it
1/21/16, 9:00 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Don't message me
1/21/16, 9:01 PM - Tanu: I don't. But if I don't reply to you, that's being mean
1/21/16, 9:02 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yeah... Thanks for not being mean.
1/21/16, 9:02 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Sorry.. I am disappointing you on multiple levels now.
1/21/16, 9:03 PM - Tanu: Yeah, you are
1/21/16, 9:03 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok
1/21/16, 9:06 PM - Tanu: I had better instincts when I was drunk than when I was sober. Should remember that for the future
1/21/16, 9:07 PM - Tanu: I could hear you
1/21/16, 9:08 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Calling
1/26/16, 12:11 AM - Tanu: Abhi, the least you could have done was given me something to close the chapter on. You owed me that much. 
Thank you for proving that I should never go against my instinct again. Any doubts I had about my ability to judge someone. Now gone
1/26/16, 12:26 AM - Tanu: They say there's a very thin line between love and hate. That's complete crap. And at this point there is really no one in this world that I hate more than you. I hate every moment I wasted with you. I hate every single time I saw you. And I never want to see you ever again. I didn't want to end this with bad blood. You made me.
1/26/16, 12:49 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: You should say that to my face if you really want to hurt me. I'm sorry you feel that way. I don't. You don't take it well when things don't go your way. Bad blood was inevitable. Take care.
1/26/16, 12:50 AM - Tanu: I have no issues saying that to your face.
1/26/16, 12:50 AM - Tanu: And no. If you would have given me a reason. I would have let it be
1/26/16, 12:51 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Love turns to hate if my reasons are not good enough
1/26/16, 12:51 AM - Tanu: You didn't give me the honest ones though
1/26/16, 12:51 AM - Tanu: And yes, because I don't get closure.
1/26/16, 12:52 AM - Tanu: That's all I wanted
1/26/16, 1:38 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Thanks. Constructive talk there. :)
1/26/16, 1:39 AM - Tanu: That's all I had asked for
1/26/16, 9:09 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Meet tomorrow?

2/7/16, 8:33 AM - Tanu: Pahty
2/7/16, 5:41 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Even I think about you non-stop
2/7/16, 5:42 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: yeah.. but if you are strong I'll be too..
2/7/16, 5:51 PM - Tanu: Thanks
2/7/16, 5:56 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: ok
2/7/16, 7:49 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Finally resolved it..
2/7/16, 7:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: 
2/7/16, 7:50 PM - Tanu: Abhi... Let's give each other space
2/7/16, 7:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yeah..ok
2/7/16, 7:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Last thing
2/7/16, 7:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: We are not doing this again..
2/7/16, 7:51 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm tired of the mini breakups
2/7/16, 7:51 PM - Tanu: But congrats :0
2/7/16, 7:51 PM - Tanu: :)
2/7/16, 7:52 PM - Tanu: What do you want to do
2/7/16, 7:52 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Next time we are in it this won't be the reason we call it off
2/7/16, 7:52 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It becomes so difficult
2/7/16, 7:53 PM - Tanu: I'm confused.. what do you mean
2/7/16, 7:53 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I mean.. We are not getting back together till both of us are sure..
2/7/16, 7:53 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: And 200% into it
2/7/16, 7:54 PM - Tanu: Agreed
2/7/16, 7:54 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I know it has mostly been from my side.. But I want you to be sure as well
2/7/16, 7:55 PM - Tanu: I agree
2/7/16, 7:55 PM - Tanu: but I can't make a decision till I atleast know you will commit
2/7/16, 7:55 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Okay
2/7/16, 8:11 PM - Tanu: I was talking to Nupur in the afternoon- she also mentioned that relationships that last generally start out clean... We have been so rocky right from them start, and even now you can't seem to come to a conclusion, it makes me wonder if we are just not meant to be
2/7/16, 8:13 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: We have been rocky for different reasons not because we don't get along with each other..
2/7/16, 8:14 PM - Tanu: Yes-  but the fact that we haven't committed to each other despite that
2/7/16, 8:14 PM - Tanu: that says something
2/7/16, 8:15 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I haven't. You seem to be almost there as far as commitment goes.
2/7/16, 8:15 PM - Tanu: And thats worrying to me
2/7/16, 8:16 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is a big decision..
2/7/16, 8:17 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Why are we having this talk now ?
2/7/16, 8:17 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Relationships that last are because of people who make it last.. Has got nothing to do with the start..
2/7/16, 8:18 PM - Tanu: I don'd disagree with that
2/7/16, 8:19 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok baccha.. Don't think so much. Let's give us some breathing space if we can
2/7/16, 8:20 PM - Tanu: just saying that whenever/ IF we do get together, we should really really hvethought it out
2/7/16, 8:20 PM - Tanu: and by we, i mean you
2/7/16, 8:20 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yes
2/7/16, 8:20 PM - Tanu: Yeah... breathing space
2/7/16, 8:22 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I know..
2/7/16, 8:22 PM - Tanu: Let me know if you ever figure it out
2/7/16, 8:22 PM - Tanu: or if you start seeing someone else
2/7/16, 8:22 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Okay
2/7/16, 8:22 PM - Tanu: And truly give me space- no messages, no emails, no phone calls
2/7/16, 8:23 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: No Snapchat snaps either ?
2/7/16, 8:23 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: :P
2/7/16, 8:23 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Haan theekh hai
2/7/16, 8:24 PM - Tanu: and if I message- ignore it
2/7/16, 8:24 PM - Tanu: Nahi
2/7/16, 8:24 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I can't do that Tanu
2/7/16, 8:25 PM - Tanu: Then I'll make sure I don't
2/7/16, 8:25 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok
2/7/16, 8:28 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm sorry baccha.. This is torture for both of us. One day we are really happy totally into each other and the next day we force ourselves to completely cut off.. We need to be better than that. By we I mean I.
2/7/16, 8:29 PM - Tanu: It's because of the happiness that I have to do it
2/7/16, 8:29 PM - Tanu: I don't want to get to a point of no return
2/7/16, 8:30 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I understand.
2/7/16, 8:32 PM - Tanu: you were typing on snapchat?
2/7/16, 8:33 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Nothing really.. Overanalyzing
2/7/16, 8:33 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: 
2/7/16, 8:44 PM - Tanu: Sure
2/7/16, 8:44 PM - Tanu: if you want to send anything, do it today
2/7/16, 9:20 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok baby
2/7/16, 9:22 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Aur kuch nahi bolna.. Be good baccha
2/7/16, 9:27 PM - Tanu: you too baby
2/7/16, 9:27 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: 
2/7/16, 9:27 PM - Tanu: please try and make a decision as soon as you can... if it's a no, thats fine
2/7/16, 9:28 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok baby
2/10/16, 10:46 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: All going good ?
2/10/16, 10:47 PM - Tanu: Have you made a decision?
2/10/16, 10:48 PM - Tanu: and yes
2/10/16, 10:48 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: So you want me to text you once I have made my decision ?
2/10/16, 10:48 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ideally yes.. I know
2/10/16, 10:48 PM - Tanu: Yeah, we can talk when you do
2/10/16, 10:49 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Okay
2/10/16, 10:49 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Not yet baccha..
2/10/16, 10:49 PM - Tanu: Ok.. Let me know when you do
2/10/16, 10:50 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Okay..
2/10/16, 10:51 PM - Tanu: I hope you're ok
2/10/16, 10:52 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Haan.. Miss you quite a bit.
2/10/16, 10:52 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Bas. Baaki sab theekh hai
2/10/16, 10:52 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: 
2/10/16, 10:53 PM - Tanu: Abhi... Don't push it
2/10/16, 10:53 PM - Tanu: When you figure your stuff out we can talk
2/10/16, 10:53 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Yeah.. Okay
2/10/16, 10:53 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Take care
2/10/16, 10:55 PM - Tanu: you too
2/10/16, 11:04 PM - Tanu: One last thing.. I know you need your time to think, but you've had 3.5 months in addition to this. If you haven't figured out what you want in a couple of weeks, you probably never will (or you'll just make a decision for the sake of it), in which case I won't be interested.
2/10/16, 11:41 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't disagree.. Last thing you need to worry about is me making a decision just for the sake of it. I ponder over things but I won't make a decision I don't believe in...
2/11/16, 5:32 AM - Tanu: My point was different. I mean that after a point your indecision will make me not care
2/11/16, 5:46 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Ok
2/11/16, 6:24 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I don't like this either..
2/11/16, 6:33 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: What happened
2/11/16, 6:33 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Busy
2/11/16, 6:33 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: ?
2/11/16, 6:33 AM - Tanu: Brb
2/11/16, 6:53 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Nothing
2/11/16, 3:00 PM - Tanu: Also- not trying to be cold. Just being realistic and making sure we dont fall in our old rut
2/11/16, 3:07 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: The old rut of being together but not being together or spending just too much time with each other ?
2/11/16, 3:15 PM - Tanu: The old rut of being together without direction
2/11/16, 3:15 PM - Tanu: But glad to know what you're thinking. Gives me perspective on what to expect
2/11/16, 3:18 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: The seed of that thought was sown by you and I agreed with it..
2/11/16, 3:19 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Or probably me.. Don't remember. Doesn't matter
2/11/16, 3:36 PM - Tanu: You're right.. It doesn't matter..
2/11/16, 3:36 PM - Tanu: But you remember it.. So it carries some significance to you
2/11/16, 11:05 PM - Tanu: Bachha... Please make a decision as soon as possible and put me out of my misery
2/12/16, 5:31 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I know mera baby.. Not at all something I want.
2/12/16, 5:38 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Just so we don't enter a fragile state of relationship again we need to keep this going for a little longer..
2/12/16, 5:39 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: We won't need to hold back then. I have no idea what feels like...
2/12/16, 5:40 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Nice pic baccha
2/12/16, 6:03 AM - Tanu: Thanks
2/12/16, 6:03 AM - Tanu: I get that
2/12/16, 6:04 AM - Tanu: Just a weak moment
2/12/16, 8:38 AM - Tanu: You have no idea what feels like?
2/12/16, 8:38 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: What that *
2/12/16, 8:38 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Stop reading my messages again
2/12/16, 8:39 AM - Tanu: Just woke up. Had replied in my sleep
2/12/16, 8:39 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Haha
2/12/16, 8:39 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: You are the cutest
2/12/16, 8:39 AM - Tanu: Whatever
2/12/16, 8:40 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: 
2/12/16, 8:44 AM - Tanu: How much longer
2/12/16, 8:52 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Impatient baccha.. Min 2 weeks
2/12/16, 8:53 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: It hasn't even been a week..
2/12/16, 8:53 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I mean 2 weeks from now
2/12/16, 8:54 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I am not trying to test your patience..
2/12/16, 8:54 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: 3 weeks is standard test time to leave a certain you behind..
2/12/16, 8:56 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Is it ok?
2/12/16, 8:57 AM - Tanu: No. This is ridiculous. You either want it or don't.
2/12/16, 8:57 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Please baccha
2/12/16, 8:57 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: This will be the only time we will be like this
2/12/16, 8:58 AM - Tanu: That's not true
2/12/16, 8:58 AM - Tanu: There are many more things after this
2/12/16, 8:58 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I mean not talking
2/12/16, 8:59 AM - Tanu: Abhi I don't understand what time will tell you. It's like we're both in this limbo. And I just want you to let me go if you can't decide so I can move on to someone else
2/12/16, 9:10 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: sorry.. was talking to a colleague. either you agree with out first decision or you don't.. Once we have decided something you can't keep changing it midway.
2/12/16, 9:10 AM - Tanu: I gave you time
2/12/16, 9:10 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: 5 days.. jeez thanks
2/12/16, 9:11 AM - Tanu: That's what I'm trying to say though. Why should it take so long
2/12/16, 9:11 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: You are free to date, find someone who you get along with, connect with...
2/12/16, 9:11 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Let me not hold you back
2/12/16, 9:11 AM - Tanu: I know that
2/12/16, 9:12 AM - Tanu: Whatever
2/12/16, 9:12 AM - Tanu: Take your time. Do what you want
2/12/16, 9:12 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Tanu.. ruk jao thoda aur please..
2/12/16, 9:12 AM - Tanu: Let's see what happens
2/12/16, 9:12 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I understand this is driving you nuts
2/12/16, 9:13 AM - Tanu: It is. I'm decisive by nature. But with this, I'm not letting myself make a decision until you do
2/12/16, 9:14 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm indecisive by nature
2/12/16, 9:14 AM - Tanu: I can tell. Make a decision. Stick to it. And have the balls to follow up
2/12/16, 9:15 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: That is below the belt ..
2/12/16, 9:15 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: When have I not stuck to my decision ?
2/12/16, 9:35 AM - Tanu: You keep wavering
2/12/16, 10:01 AM - Tanu: Isn't that the same as not sticking to it
2/12/16, 10:11 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: No.. We never made any decision.
2/12/16, 10:12 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: Well.. Let me put it this way. I am not ready.
 If I am, awesome. If I am not.. good luck
2/12/16, 10:17 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: And this discussion... is over
2/12/16, 10:52 AM - Tanu: You're not ready to make a decision or to commit?
2/12/16, 10:57 AM - Tanu: at least answer
2/12/16, 11:01 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm not ready to talk to you!
2/12/16, 11:01 AM - Abhinav Sarapure: quit asking so many questions
2/12/16, 11:01 AM - Tanu: ok... Give me a date when you'll be ready

2/26/16, 8:02 PM - Tanu: Hello baby. 
Even typing this out seems so incredibly crazy yet surreal at the same time. We've known each other for a while now and I can't really remember a time when I didn't know you. 
Yesterday, I was talking to a friend of mine, and she said one thing that stuck with me. She said it's always easy with the person you're meant to be with, you don't need to make an effort. 
So yes baby, I want to give this a shot too. A good, honest try. 
I know this doesn't mean happily ever after. But I want one things from you. If at any point in all this you change your mind or have doubts about us, talk to me. I need to know. 
Apart from that I'm really excited for the next few weeks and all the madness that will ensue. 
Love you loads baby and can't wait to see you tonight

3/1/16, 5:08 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: do you know why I switched from electronics to coding ?
3/1/16, 5:09 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: won't wait till you say why...
3/1/16, 5:09 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is because of Tennis
3/1/16, 5:09 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: lol
3/1/16, 5:15 PM - Tanu: really
3/1/16, 5:15 PM - Tanu: I thought you just liked this more
3/1/16, 5:24 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I like it more because I like the meta part of coding more than electronics.. Long story short
3/1/16, 5:25 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I think it was some sunny day when I was playing tennis and thought to myself .. I really like the feedback loop of tennis. really tight turnaround. every shot tells me something.
3/1/16, 5:25 PM - Tanu: i dont understand that
3/1/16, 5:26 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: don't know if that was true.. but compared coding , was probably dabbling a bit in it.. and electronics..
3/1/16, 5:26 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: and tadaaa... coding it is..
3/1/16, 5:26 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: likely that I didn't understand much of electronics too which helped make this decision.
3/1/16, 5:26 PM - Tanu: acha got it

3/22/16, 2:40 PM - Tanu: ok
3/22/16, 2:41 PM - Tanu: This is what my mom sent: Hi ! Tanvi is also busy for the next few weeks applying for jobs and finishing assignments and projects. I have communicated to her to get in touch with Omkar but it may be a while before she is able to do so.
3/22/16, 2:41 PM - Tanu: which I dont like
3/22/16, 2:42 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I have no idea how you put up with all this ...
3/22/16, 2:42 PM - Tanu: I'm not fighting with my parents on this
3/22/16, 2:43 PM - Tanu: for them a relationship means nothing until there is formal commitment- they don't respect it
3/22/16, 2:43 PM - Tanu: So instead of letting them do what they want
3/22/16, 2:43 PM - Tanu: I am taking it into my own hands
3/22/16, 2:43 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: That's fine for me..
3/22/16, 2:44 PM - Tanu: what is
3/22/16, 2:44 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: what is not fine is responding to an email of that sort ..
3/22/16, 2:44 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: that was sent by the guy's mom
3/22/16, 2:44 PM - Tanu: I'm confused- let me call you asap
3/22/16, 3:07 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: have a meeting in 20 mins
3/22/16, 3:07 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: talk after that ?
3/22/16, 3:08 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: i'll message
3/22/16, 3:08 PM - Tanu: I have a class from 3:30 to 5:30
3/22/16, 3:09 PM - Tanu: and in one now
3/22/16, 3:09 PM - Tanu: will try and call in between 3:20 and 3:30
3/22/16, 3:09 PM - Tanu: or just explain what you mean
3/22/16, 3:09 PM - Tanu: in detail
3/22/16, 3:09 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: one sec
3/22/16, 3:09 PM - Tanu: ok
3/22/16, 3:10 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Why do you have to respond to such demeaning emails ?
3/22/16, 3:10 PM - Tanu: hmmm... I agree with that
3/22/16, 3:11 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: I'm furious that it has come to this that you are having to sending a polite reply
3/22/16, 3:11 PM - Tanu: and that question alone makes me not interested- but having been on these sites for a while and knowing how indian societies work- as a girl, it's something you have to deal with
3/22/16, 3:12 PM - Tanu: and he is not the first one to ask
3/22/16, 3:13 PM - Tanu: my parents should be the one responding to this in the appropriate way- but thats not the way they deal with this- from their point of view, he's a decent guy with a good career, and don't dismiss him on one question
3/22/16, 3:14 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Not interested is such a mild response. That one question explains his entire mentality. He will be asking you about whether your virginity next.
3/22/16, 3:14 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Such regressive nonsense
3/22/16, 3:14 PM - Tanu: abhi- that I don't agree with
3/22/16, 3:15 PM - Tanu: Yeah asking this question through his mom rather than waiting to see me and judge for himself is immature- it doesn't mean he is regressive, it means he cares about how his partner looks
3/22/16, 3:15 PM - Tanu: which is his choice
3/22/16, 3:16 PM - Tanu: every guy does it to a certain extent, clearly it matters a lot to him
3/22/16, 3:16 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: You give the other person way too much benefit of doubt.
3/22/16, 3:17 PM - Tanu: it's not a benefit of doubt
3/22/16, 3:17 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: It is .. You don't know anything about him.
3/22/16, 3:18 PM - Tanu: exactly
3/22/16, 3:18 PM - Tanu: which is why i can't base my opinion of him on one question
3/22/16, 3:19 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Well, any guy fine with asking such questions through his mom is clearly going about all this the wrong way
3/22/16, 3:20 PM - Tanu: exactly
3/22/16, 3:20 PM - Tanu: and that is exactly what i told my mom
3/22/16, 3:20 PM - Tanu: You have to understand- I'm not saying no just for the heck of it- it his mother and him can ask such questions through a text message without knowing me at all, they are not the kind of people I want to be ith
3/22/16, 3:20 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Urggh... We are going around in circles on this
3/22/16, 3:20 PM - Tanu: thats what I sent her
3/22/16, 3:23 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Anyway.. This is utter bs you got to put up with.. 
I don't mind you replying to people or their moms but an email like this deserves no response.. And your mom should be the one doing that.
3/22/16, 3:24 PM - Abhinav Sarapure: Will speak later. Gtg
3/22/16, 9:34 PM - Tanu: sleeping
